## Research Statement

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida International University.My primary research focus is to improve our understanding of how climate and disturbance regimes influence spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem structure and function. Using remote sensing, eddy covariance, and spatial and temporal models I explores questions related to ecosystem condition, sustainability, and vulnerability to climate extremes. <http://malonelab.fiu.edu>

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
