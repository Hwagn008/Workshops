Research Statement
==================

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida International University. My primary research focus is to improve our understanding of how climate and disturbance regimes influence spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem structure and function. Using remote sensing, eddy covariance, and spatial and temporal models I explores questions related to ecosystem condition, sustainability, and vulnerability to climate extremes. <http://malonelab.fiu.edu>

Objectives and Hypothesis
=========================

The primary objective of my project is to evaluate seasonal differences in photosynthetic potential in an Everglades freshwater wetland. Understanding C dynamics is challenging due to the variety of factors influencing the system. In of the most important factors being hydrology. I hypothesize the photosynthetic potential at the ecosystem scale is driven by canopy exposure, which is controlled by water levels. When inundated primary productivity should decline as the amount of leaf area below the water surface increases.

Methods (Dataset and Statistical Analysis)
==========================================

I will evaluate changes in the photosynthetic potential of Everglades wetlands using data collected at TS/PH1, and long-term Ecological Research and AmeriFlux research site. Here, an eddy covariance tower is positioned to measure Net Ecosystem Exchange Rates and meteorological data. All data is made available to the public through AmeriFlux. I will download data from 2008 until the present and fit monthly light and temperature response curves. I will then use time series analysis to decompose the time series of maximum photosynthetic rates and auto-regressive integrated moving average analysis to evaluate hydrology as a driver of maximum photosynthetic rates.
